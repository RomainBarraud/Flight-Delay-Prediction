# Flight Delay Prediction

[This project](https://hackmd.io/s/SyXikdg_g#Flight-Delay-Prediction) is based on an assesment from [Terminal 1](https://www.terminal1.co/).
The objective is to build a predictive model forecasting flight delay with the final purpose to minimize the gap between claimed and budgetted fee.

## Getting Started

There are 2 ways to use my project:
* Using the jupyter notebook, running all the notebook and then inputing your won dataset in the very last function to obtain the predictions
* Going online to make one predicition using a webservice hosted on AWS

### Prerequisites

* For **online prediction**
You need... nothing! An Internet connection... at least.
* For the **jupyter notebook**
  *  anaconda 4.5.8
  *  python 3.6.4
  *  numpy 1.14.0
  *  pandas 0.22.0
  *  matplolib 2.1.2
  *  seaborn 0.8.1
  *  scikit-learn 0.19.1
  *  keras 2.1.6
  *  tensorflow 1.8.0
  *  folium 0.6.0
  *  branca 0.3.0
 For the **flask app**
  *  flask 1.0.2

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
